Bamboo Mobile Health Android Tablet App

Purpose
This app aims to facilitate communication among patients and doctors. The app targets senior citizen patients impacted by Parkinson’s disease. There clearly exists inefficiencies in terms of how patients communicate with their doctors. Most of the patients meet with their doctors once every 3 to 4 months. Usually the doctors ask for their health information during their meetings, but the patients do not remember any details about their past symptoms. It thus becomes harder and harder to track the patients’ health status and to check whether the medicine actually works. By using this app, patients can record their health information and inform their doctors consistently. Also, it makes it easier for doctors to view their patients’ health information easily and drive medicine decisions accordingly.

The primary usability goals would be simplicity and “hands off” orientation. We expect users to put their devices as kitchen countertop installation. We will primarily focus on two areas. The first one is consumer content delivery. We will incorporate family photo streaming service and daily weather updates, and possibly other forms of entertainment for seniors. By doing so, we encourage seniors to use the app consistently. The second one is medical query delivery and response capture to populate a server side database related to medication and symptom information.
