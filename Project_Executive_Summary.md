Project: mHealth Seniors

WHAT is the application going to do. Overview.
The application facilitates interaction among patients and doctors. It records senior patients’ levels of symptoms and reminds them to take medicine as their doctors ask on a daily basis. It also display health information of the senior patients in a more convenience and user-friendly way to doctors. 

WHY is your application important. Describe the purpose.
The application is important because it is (probably?) going to be used for patients with Parkinson’s disease. In the end, it will benefit the patients and also benefit their care providers with communication.
The use cases would target:
	A) senior citizen patient impacted by Parkinson's disease
	B) Simplicity and "hands off" orientation would be primary usability goals
	C) Device would be dedicated to kitchen countertop installation
	D) App would enable the device to perform 2 functions:
		1) Consumer content delivery (either family photos, weather, or other entertainment)
		2) medical query delivery and reponse capture to populate a server side database related to medication and/or symptoms

Describe the functionality.
This project is interesting because Ray envisions the users interacting more with their tablet than they do with a mobile application. For example, a remote person close to the patient might be able to update their tablet display by uploading pictures. The tablet would then also serve the useful function of notifying patients when they need to be notified. We would also work with amazon web services on the back end to consolidate the information. Ray has told us of quite a few tentative ideas and projects. The details of the functionality will be clearer in the near future when we make a more final decision.

Write about technical consideration like platform choice etc. Expenses are important. For example will the client have to pay for a server?
We choose to develop an Android app on Android tablets. We intend to use Amazon web services for storage of data. The client will give us Amazon developer accounts and provide financial support for servers. He will also secure android tablets for our testing uses.
